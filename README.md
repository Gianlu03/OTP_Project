# School Project

The teacher's assignment in 2021 was to develop a free choice project including a crypthography algorithm (in pairs, mate: @MarcoCalmetti).

We agreed on creating a simple web application, which requests the user(registered to the DB) to insert his email and password to log in.
After passing the first page, the software requires an OTP to complete the login procedure.

The OTP is generated by a C script, which is runned by an Arduino board that reveals the code thanks to a tiny display.

Based upon current time, the C script creates a string, which is encripted with the RC5 algorithm(goal). some characters are taken from the resulting string to create a shorter one.
A PHP script gathers the information given by the user and checks with the same algorithm if the OTP inserted is valid.

@Gianlu03 dealth with the Web page creation, both in graphic and functionality,.
@MarcoCalmetti handled the component's assembly on the Arduino Board and the C script.
